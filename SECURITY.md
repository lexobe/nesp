Security Policy

Reporting
- Please report vulnerabilities privately via issues marked as security or via email to the maintainers (do not open public PoC before coordinated disclosure).

Scope
- Contract logic (state machine, invariants, timers), signature verification (EIP-712/IERC1271), withdrawal logic, and (if enabled) meta-tx subject resolution (2771/4337).

Expectations
- Provide a minimal reproducible example, affected invariant (INV.*), and expected vs actual outcomes. If relevant, include gas griefing or DoS considerations.
